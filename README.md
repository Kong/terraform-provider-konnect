## Usage

The provider can be installed from the Terraform registry. Before using the provider, you must configure a `personal_access_token`. If you are running in a non-US region, you must also set the `server_url` configuration option.

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    konnect = {
      source  = "kong/konnect"
    }
  }
}

provider "konnect" {
  personal_access_token = "kpat_YOUR_PAT"
  server_url            = "https://us.api.konghq.com"
}
```

You may also configure the `provider` block using environment variables:

- `personal_access_token` = `KONNECT_TOKEN`
- `system_account_access_token` = `KONNECT_SPAT`
- `server_url` = `KONNECT_SERVER_URL`

e.g. `KONNECT_TOKEN=kpat_YOUR_PAT terraform apply`

## Examples

The examples directory contains sample usage for all supported resources. For a full list of supported parameters for each resource, see the [provider documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Kong/konnect/latest/docs).

The examples in this repo reference resources that are expected to exist in your manifests e.g. `konnect_gateway_control_plane.tfdemo.id`. Update the references to match the names that you have given your resources.
