  cp_id = "bf138ba2-c9b1-4229-b268-04d9d8a6410b"
  labels = {
    key = "value",
  }
  mesh = "...my_mesh..."

## Schema

### Required

- `cp_id` (String) Id of the Konnect resource
- `mesh` (String) name of the mesh
- `name` (String) name of the MeshTrafficPermission
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTrafficPermission resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `type` (String) the type of the resource. must be "MeshTrafficPermission"

### Optional

- `labels` (Map of String) The labels to help identity resources

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (String) Time at which the resource was created
- `modification_time` (String) Time at which the resource was updated
- `warnings` (List of String) warnings is a list of warning messages to return to the requesting Kuma API clients.
Warning messages describe a problem the client making the API request should correct or be aware of.

<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Optional:

- `from` (Attributes List) From list makes a match between clients and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource the policy takes an effect on.
The resource could be either a real store object or virtual resource
defined inplace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--from"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from`

Optional:

- `default` (Attributes) Default is a configuration specific to the group of clients referenced in
'targetRef' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource that represents a group of
clients.
Not Null (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--default"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default`

Optional:

- `action` (String) Action defines a behavior for the specified group of clients:. must be one of ["Allow", "Deny", "AllowWithShadowDeny"]


<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--target_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.target_ref`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource. must be one of ["Mesh", "MeshSubset", "MeshGateway", "MeshService", "MeshExternalService", "MeshMultiZoneService", "MeshServiceSubset", "MeshHTTPRoute", "Dataplane"]
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are used to select group of MeshServices that match labels. Either Labels or
Name and Namespace can be used.
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is reserved for future use to identify cross mesh resources.
- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds
`MeshSubset` and `MeshServiceSubset`



<a id="nestedatt--spec--target_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.target_ref`

Optional:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource. must be one of ["Mesh", "MeshSubset", "MeshGateway", "MeshService", "MeshExternalService", "MeshMultiZoneService", "MeshServiceSubset", "MeshHTTPRoute", "Dataplane"]
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are used to select group of MeshServices that match labels. Either Labels or
Name and Namespace can be used.
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is reserved for future use to identify cross mesh resources.
- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds
`MeshSubset` and `MeshServiceSubset`

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import konnect_mesh_traffic_permission.my_konnect_mesh_traffic_permission "{ \"cp_id\": \"bf138ba2-c9b1-4229-b268-04d9d8a6410b\",  \"mesh\": \"\",  \"name\": \"\"}"
```
