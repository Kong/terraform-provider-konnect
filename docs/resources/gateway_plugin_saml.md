## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager.

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `consumer` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `consumer_group` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer_group))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `instance_name` (String)
- `protocols` (List of String) A list of the request protocols that will trigger this plugin. The default value, as well as the possible values allowed on this field, may change depending on the plugin type. For example, plugins that only work in stream mode will only support `"tcp"` and `"tls"`.
- `route` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Route being used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--route))
- `service` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin for grouping and filtering.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

### Nested Schema for `config`

Optional:

- `request_signing_certificate` (String) The certificate for signing requests.

- `session_absolute_timeout` (Number) The session cookie absolute timeout in seconds. Specifies how long the session can be used until it is no longer valid.
- `session_audience` (String) The session audience, for example "my-application"

- `session_cookie_path` (String) A string representing a URL path, such as /path/to/resource. Must start with a forward slash (/) and must not contain empty segments (i.e., two consecutive forward slashes).
- `session_cookie_same_site` (String) Controls whether a cookie is sent with cross-origin requests, providing some protection against cross-site request forgery attacks. must be one of ["Strict", "Lax", "None", "Default"]
- `session_cookie_secure` (Boolean) The cookie is only sent to the server when a request is made with the https:scheme (except on localhost), and therefore is more resistant to man-in-the-middle attacks.
- `session_enforce_same_subject` (Boolean) When set to `true`, audiences are forced to share the same subject.
- `session_hash_storage_key` (Boolean) When set to `true`, the storage key (session ID) is hashed for extra security. Hashing the storage key means it is impossible to decrypt data from the storage without a cookie.
- `session_hash_subject` (Boolean) When set to `true`, the value of subject is hashed before being stored. Only applies when `session_store_metadata` is enabled.
- `session_idling_timeout` (Number) The session cookie idle time in seconds.

- `session_redis_prefix` (String) The Redis session key prefix.
- `session_redis_read_timeout` (Number) The Redis read timeout in milliseconds.

- `session_redis_ssl_verify` (Boolean) Verify the Redis server certificate.
- `session_redis_username` (String) Redis username if the `redis` session storage is defined and ACL authentication is desired.If undefined, ACL authentication will not be performed.  This requires Redis v6.0.0+. The username **cannot** be set to `default`.

- `session_storage` (String) The session storage for session data: - `cookie`: stores session data with the session cookie. The session cannot be invalidated or revoked without changing the session secret, but is stateless, and doesn't require a database. - `memcached`: stores session data in memcached - `redis`: stores session data in Redis. must be one of ["cookie", "memcache", "memcached", "redis"]
- `session_store_metadata` (Boolean) Configures whether or not session metadata should be stored. This includes information about the active sessions for the `specific_audience` belonging to a specific subject.
