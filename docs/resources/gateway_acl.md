## Schema

### Required

- `consumer_id` (String) Consumer ID for nested entities. Requires replacement if changed.
- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.
- `group` (String) Requires replacement if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_gateway_acl.my_konnect_gateway_acl
  id = jsonencode({
    consumer_id = "f28acbfa-c866-4587-b688-0208ac24df21"
    control_plane_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
    id = "f28acbfa-c866-4587-b688-0208ac24df21"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_gateway_acl.my_konnect_gateway_acl '{"consumer_id": "f28acbfa-c866-4587-b688-0208ac24df21", "control_plane_id": "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458", "id": "f28acbfa-c866-4587-b688-0208ac24df21"}'
```
