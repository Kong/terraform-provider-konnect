## Schema

### Required

- `endpoint` (String) The endpoint that will receive audit log messages.
- `name` (String) The name of the audit log destination.

### Optional

- `authorization` (String) The value to include in the `Authorization` header when sending audit logs to the webhook.
- `log_format` (String) The output format of each log messages. Default: "cef"; must be one of ["cef", "json", "cps"]
- `skip_ssl_verification` (Boolean) Indicates if the SSL certificate verification of the host endpoint should be skipped when delivering payloads.
We strongly recommend not setting this to 'true' as you are subject to man-in-the-middle and other attacks.
This option should be considered only for self-signed SSL certificates used in a non-production environment.
Default: false

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp when this webhook was created.
- `id` (String) The unique ID of the audit log destination.
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp when this webhook was last updated. Initial value is 0001-01-01T00:00:0Z.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_audit_log_destination.my_konnect_audit_log_destination
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_audit_log_destination.my_konnect_audit_log_destination "..."
```
