# konnect_gateway_target (Resource)

GatewayTarget Resource

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "konnect_gateway_target" "my_gatewaytarget" {
  control_plane_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
  created_at       = 2.48
  id               = "...my_id..."
  tags = [
    "..."
  ]
  target     = "...my_target..."
  updated_at = 6.8
  upstream = {
    id = "...my_id..."
  }
  upstream_id = "5a078780-5d4c-4aae-984a-bdc6f52113d8"
  weight      = 32684
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.
- `target` (String) The target address (ip or hostname) and port. If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, the `port` value will be overridden by the value from the DNS record. Requires replacement if changed.
- `upstream_id` (String) ID or target of the Target to lookup. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created. Requires replacement if changed.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier). Requires replacement if changed.
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Target for grouping and filtering. Requires replacement if changed.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated. Requires replacement if changed.
- `upstream` (Attributes) The unique identifier or the name of the upstream for which to update the target. Requires replacement if changed. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--upstream))
- `weight` (Number) The weight this target gets within the upstream loadbalancer (`0`-`65535`). If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, the `weight` value will be overridden by the value from the DNS record. Default: 100; Requires replacement if changed.

### Nested Schema for `upstream`

Optional:

- `id` (String) Requires replacement if changed.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_gateway_target.my_konnect_gateway_target
  id = jsonencode({
    control_plane_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
    id = "5a078780-5d4c-4aae-984a-bdc6f52113d8"
    upstream_id = "5a078780-5d4c-4aae-984a-bdc6f52113d8"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_gateway_target.my_konnect_gateway_target '{"control_plane_id": "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458", "id": "5a078780-5d4c-4aae-984a-bdc6f52113d8", "upstream_id": "5a078780-5d4c-4aae-984a-bdc6f52113d8"}'
```
