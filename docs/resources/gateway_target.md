  tags = [
    "..."
  ]
  target      = "...my_target..."
  upstream_id = "5a078780-5d4c-4aae-984a-bdc6f52113d8"

## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.
- `upstream_id` (String) ID or target of the Target to lookup. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Target for grouping and filtering. Requires replacement if changed.
- `target` (String) The target address (ip or hostname) and port. If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, the `port` value will be overridden by the value from the DNS record. Requires replacement if changed.
- `weight` (Number) The weight this target gets within the upstream loadbalancer (`0`-`65535`). If the hostname resolves to an SRV record, the `weight` value will be overridden by the value from the DNS record. Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
- `upstream` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--upstream))

<a id="nestedatt--upstream"></a>
### Nested Schema for `upstream`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String)
