## Schema

### Required

- `content` (String) The renderable markdown content of a page in a portal.
- `portal_id` (String) The Portal identifier
- `slug` (String) The slug of a page in a portal, used to compute its full URL path within the portal hierarchy.
When a page has a `parent_page_id`, its full path is built by joining the parent’s slug with its own.
For example, if a parent page has the slug `slug1` and this page’s slug is `slug2`, the resulting path will be `/slug1/slug2`.
This enables nested page structures like `/slug1/slug2/slug3`.

### Optional

- `description` (String)
- `parent_page_id` (String) Pages may be rendered as a tree of files.

Specify the `id` of another page as the `parent_page_id` to add some hierarchy to your pages.
- `status` (String) Whether the resource is visible on a given portal. Defaults to unpublished. must be one of ["published", "unpublished"]
- `title` (String) The title of a page in a portal.
- `visibility` (String) Whether a page is publicly accessible to non-authenticated users.
If not provided, the default_page_visibility value of the portal will be used.
must be one of ["public", "private"]

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) An ISO-8601 timestamp representation of entity creation date.
- `id` (String) Contains a unique identifier used for this resource.
- `updated_at` (String) An ISO-8601 timestamp representation of entity update date.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_portal_page.my_konnect_portal_page
  id = jsonencode({
    id = "ebbac5b0-ac89-45c3-9d2e-c4542c657e79"
    portal_id = "f32d905a-ed33-46a3-a093-d8f536af9a8a"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_portal_page.my_konnect_portal_page '{"id": "ebbac5b0-ac89-45c3-9d2e-c4542c657e79", "portal_id": "f32d905a-ed33-46a3-a093-d8f536af9a8a"}'
```
