## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.
- `name` (String) This is a hostname, which must be equal to the `host` of a Service.

### Optional

- `algorithm` (String) Which load balancing algorithm to use. Default: "round-robin"; must be one of ["consistent-hashing", "least-connections", "round-robin", "latency", "sticky-sessions"]
- `client_certificate` (Attributes) If set, the certificate to be used as client certificate while TLS handshaking to the upstream server. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--client_certificate))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `hash_fallback` (String) What to use as hashing input if the primary `hash_on` does not return a hash (eg. header is missing, or no Consumer identified). Not available if `hash_on` is set to `cookie`. Default: "none"; must be one of ["none", "consumer", "ip", "header", "cookie", "path", "query_arg", "uri_capture"]
- `hash_fallback_header` (String) The header name to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_fallback` is set to `header`.
- `hash_fallback_query_arg` (String) The name of the query string argument to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_fallback` is set to `query_arg`.
- `hash_fallback_uri_capture` (String) The name of the route URI capture to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_fallback` is set to `uri_capture`.
- `hash_on` (String) What to use as hashing input. Using `none` results in a weighted-round-robin scheme with no hashing. Default: "none"; must be one of ["none", "consumer", "ip", "header", "cookie", "path", "query_arg", "uri_capture"]
- `hash_on_cookie` (String) The cookie name to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_on` or `hash_fallback` is set to `cookie`. If the specified cookie is not in the request, Kong will generate a value and set the cookie in the response.
- `hash_on_cookie_path` (String) The cookie path to set in the response headers. Only required when `hash_on` or `hash_fallback` is set to `cookie`. Default: "/"
- `hash_on_header` (String) The header name to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_on` is set to `header`.
- `hash_on_query_arg` (String) The name of the query string argument to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_on` is set to `query_arg`.
- `hash_on_uri_capture` (String) The name of the route URI capture to take the value from as hash input. Only required when `hash_on` is set to `uri_capture`.
- `healthchecks` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--healthchecks))
- `host_header` (String) The hostname to be used as `Host` header when proxying requests through Kong.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `slots` (Number) The number of slots in the load balancer algorithm. If `algorithm` is set to `round-robin`, this setting determines the maximum number of slots. If `algorithm` is set to `consistent-hashing`, this setting determines the actual number of slots in the algorithm. Accepts an integer in the range `10`-`65536`. Default: 10000
- `sticky_sessions_cookie` (String) The cookie name to keep sticky sessions.
- `sticky_sessions_cookie_path` (String) A string representing a URL path, such as /path/to/resource. Must start with a forward slash (/) and must not contain empty segments (i.e., two consecutive forward slashes). Default: "/"
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Upstream for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
- `use_srv_name` (Boolean) If set, the balancer will use SRV hostname(if DNS Answer has SRV record) as the proxy upstream `Host`. Default: false
