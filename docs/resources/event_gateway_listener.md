## Schema

### Required

- `addresses` (List of String) Which address or addresses to listen on.
`0.0.0.0` means all addresses on the host.
`::` means all addresses on the host in IPv6.

  If `0.0.0.0` or `::` is used, there can't be other extra addresses defined.
  WARNING: there are use cases where listening on all addresses is insecure. So use this with caution.

  `localhost` means only the localhost ipv4 address.
- `gateway_id` (String) The UUID of your Gateway.
- `name` (String) The unique name of the listener.
- `ports` (List of String) Which port or ports to listen on.
There can be multiple ways to define ports:
  - as a single port, e.g. 9092
  - as a range of ports, e.g. 9092-9094

It's possible to combine both, e.g. [9092, "9093-9095", 9096].

### Optional

- `description` (String) A human-readable description of the virtual cluster.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels store metadata of an entity that can be used for filtering an entity list or for searching across entity types. 

Keys must be of length 1-63 characters, and cannot start with "kong", "konnect", "mesh", "kic", or "_".

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) An ISO-8601 timestamp representation of entity creation date.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the listener.
- `updated_at` (String) An ISO-8601 timestamp representation of entity update date.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_event_gateway_listener.my_konnect_event_gateway_listener
  id = jsonencode({
    gateway_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
    id = "..."
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_event_gateway_listener.my_konnect_event_gateway_listener '{"gateway_id": "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458", "id": "..."}'
```
