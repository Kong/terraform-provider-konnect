## Schema

### Required

- `description` (String) Description of the system account. Useful when the system account name is not sufficient to differentiate one system account from another.
- `name` (String) Name of the system account.

### Optional

- `konnect_managed` (Boolean) The system account is managed by Konnect (true/false). Requires replacement if changed.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) Timestamp of when the system account was created.
- `id` (String) ID of the system account.
- `updated_at` (String) Timestamp of when the system account was last updated.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_system_account.my_konnect_system_account
  id = "..."
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_system_account.my_konnect_system_account "..."
```
