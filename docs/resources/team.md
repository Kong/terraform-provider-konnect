## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) A name for the team being created.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the new team.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels store metadata of an entity that can be used for filtering an entity list or for searching across entity types. 

Keys must be of length 1-63 characters, and cannot start with "kong", "konnect", "mesh", "kic", or "_".

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (String) A Unix timestamp representation of team creation.
- `id` (String) The team ID.
- `system_team` (Boolean) Returns True if a user belongs to a `system_team`. System teams are teams that can manage Konnect objects, like "Organization Admin", or "Service". Default: false
- `updated_at` (String) A Unix timestamp representation of the most recent change to the team object in Konnect.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_team.my_konnect_team
  id = "7f9fd312-a987-4628-b4c5-bb4f4fddd5f7"
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_team.my_konnect_team "7f9fd312-a987-4628-b4c5-bb4f4fddd5f7"
```
