## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `custom_id` (String) Field for storing an existing unique ID for the Consumer - useful for mapping Kong with users in your existing database. You must send either this field or `username` with the request.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Consumer for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
- `username` (String) The unique username of the Consumer. You must send either this field or `custom_id` with the request.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_gateway_consumer.my_konnect_gateway_consumer
  id = jsonencode({
    control_plane_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
    id = "c1059869-6fa7-4329-a5f5-5946d14ca2c5"
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_gateway_consumer.my_konnect_gateway_consumer '{"control_plane_id": "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458", "id": "c1059869-6fa7-4329-a5f5-5946d14ca2c5"}'
```
