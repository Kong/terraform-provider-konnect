## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

In Terraform v1.5.0 and later, the [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) can be used with the `id` attribute, for example:

```terraform
import {
  to = konnect_event_gateway_static_key.my_konnect_event_gateway_static_key
  id = jsonencode({
    gateway_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
    id = "..."
  })
}
```

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import konnect_event_gateway_static_key.my_konnect_event_gateway_static_key '{"gateway_id": "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458", "id": "..."}'
```
