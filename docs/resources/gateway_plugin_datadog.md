## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.

### Optional

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `consumer` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers this way.). Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `instance_name` (String)
- `ordering` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ordering))
- `protocols` (List of String) A set of strings representing protocols.
- `route` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via the specified route. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the route being used. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--route))
- `service` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will only activate when receiving requests via one of the routes belonging to the specified Service. Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the Service being matched. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Plugin for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

- `flush_timeout` (Number) Optional time in seconds. If `queue_size` > 1, this is the max idle time before sending a log with less than `queue_size` records.
- `host` (String) A string representing a host name, such as example.com.
- `metrics` (Attributes List) List of metrics to be logged. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--metrics))
- `port` (Number) An integer representing a port number between 0 and 65535, inclusive.
- `prefix` (String) String to be attached as a prefix to a metric's name.
- `queue` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--queue))
- `queue_size` (Number) Maximum number of log entries to be sent on each message to the upstream server.
- `retry_count` (Number) Number of times to retry when sending data to the upstream server.
