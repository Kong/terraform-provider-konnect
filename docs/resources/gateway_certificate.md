## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "konnect_gateway_certificate" "my_gatewaycertificate" {
  cert             = "...my_cert..."
  cert_alt         = "...my_cert_alt..."
  control_plane_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
  created_at       = 10
  id               = "...my_id..."
  key              = "...my_key..."

## Schema

### Required

- `cert` (String) PEM-encoded public certificate chain of the SSL key pair. This field is _referenceable_, which means it can be securely stored as a [secret](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/getting-started) in a vault. References must follow a [specific format](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/reference-format).
- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager. Requires replacement if changed.
- `key` (String) PEM-encoded private key of the SSL key pair. This field is _referenceable_, which means it can be securely stored as a [secret](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/getting-started) in a vault. References must follow a [specific format](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/reference-format).

### Optional

- `cert_alt` (String) PEM-encoded public certificate chain of the alternate SSL key pair. This should only be set if you have both RSA and ECDSA types of certificate available and would like Kong to prefer serving using ECDSA certs when client advertises support for it. This field is _referenceable_, which means it can be securely stored as a [secret](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/getting-started) in a vault. References must follow a [specific format](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/reference-format).
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `id` (String) A string representing a UUID (universally unique identifier).
- `key_alt` (String) PEM-encoded private key of the alternate SSL key pair. This should only be set if you have both RSA and ECDSA types of certificate available and would like Kong to prefer serving using ECDSA certs when client advertises support for it. This field is _referenceable_, which means it can be securely stored as a [secret](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/getting-started) in a vault. References must follow a [specific format](/gateway/latest/plan-and-deploy/security/secrets-management/reference-format).
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Certificate for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.

### Read-Only

- `snis` (List of String)

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
terraform import konnect_gateway_certificate.my_konnect_gateway_certificate '{"control_plane_id": "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458", "id": "ddf3cdaa-3329-4961-822a-ce6dbd38eff7"}'
