- `is_public` (Boolean) Whether the portal catalog can be accessed publicly without any developer authentication. Developer accounts and applications cannot be created if the portal is public.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels store metadata of an entity that can be used for filtering an entity list or for searching across entity types. 

Keys must be of length 1-63 characters, and cannot start with "kong", "konnect", "mesh", "kic", or "_".
