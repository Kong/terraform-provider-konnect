### Nested Schema for `data`

Read-Only:

- `application_count` (Number) Number of applications created in the portal.
- `auto_approve_applications` (Boolean) Whether the requests from applications to register for products will be automatically approved, or if they will be set to pending until approved by an admin.
- `auto_approve_developers` (Boolean) Whether the developer account registrations will be automatically approved, or if they will be set to pending until approved by an admin.
- `custom_client_domain` (String) The custom domain to access a self-hosted customized developer portal client. If this is set, the Konnect-hosted portal client will no longer be available. `custom_domain` must be also set for this value to be set. See https://github.com/Kong/konnect-portal for information on how to get started deploying and customizing your own Konnect portal.
- `custom_domain` (String) The custom domain to access the developer portal. A CNAME for the portal's default domain must be able to be set for the custom domain for it to be valid. After setting a valid CNAME, an SSL/TLS certificate will be automatically manged for the custom domain, and traffic will be able to use the custom domain to route to the portal's web client and API.
- `default_application_auth_strategy_id` (String) Default strategy ID applied on applications for the portal
- `default_domain` (String) The domain assigned to the portal by Konnect. This is the default place to access the portal and its API if not using a `custom_domain``.

- `developer_count` (Number) Number of developers using the portal.
- `display_name` (String) The display name of the portal. This value will be the portal's `name` in Portal API.
- `id` (String) Contains a unique identifier used by the API for this resource.
- `is_public` (Boolean) Whether the portal catalog can be accessed publicly without any developer authentication. Developer accounts and applications cannot be created if the portal is public.
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels store metadata of an entity that can be used for filtering an entity list or for searching across entity types. 

Keys must be of length 1-63 characters, and cannot start with "kong", "konnect", "mesh", "kic", or "_".
- `name` (String) The name of the portal, used to distinguish it from other portals. Name must be unique.
- `published_product_count` (Number) Number of api products published to the portal
