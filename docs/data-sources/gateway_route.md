# konnect_gateway_route (Data Source)

GatewayRoute DataSource

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "konnect_gateway_route" "my_gatewayroute" {
  control_plane_id = "9524ec7d-36d9-465d-a8c5-83a3c9390458"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager.

### Read-Only

- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `destinations` (Attributes List) A list of IP destinations of incoming connections that match this Route when using stream routing. Each entry is an object with fields "ip" (optionally in CIDR range notation) and/or "port". (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--destinations))
- `headers` (Map of String) One or more lists of values indexed by header name that will cause this Route to match if present in the request. The `Host` header cannot be used with this attribute: hosts should be specified using the `hosts` attribute. When `headers` contains only one value and that value starts with the special prefix `~*`, the value is interpreted as a regular expression.
- `hosts` (List of String) A list of domain names that match this Route. Note that the hosts value is case sensitive.
- `https_redirect_status_code` (Number) The status code Kong responds with when all properties of a Route match except the protocol i.e. if the protocol of the request is `HTTP` instead of `HTTPS`. `Location` header is injected by Kong if the field is set to 301, 302, 307 or 308. Note: This config applies only if the Route is configured to only accept the `https` protocol.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `methods` (List of String) A list of HTTP methods that match this Route.
- `name` (String) The name of the Route. Route names must be unique, and they are case sensitive. For example, there can be two different Routes named "test" and "Test".
- `path_handling` (String) Controls how the Service path, Route path and requested path are combined when sending a request to the upstream. See above for a detailed description of each behavior.
- `paths` (List of String) A list of paths that match this Route.
- `preserve_host` (Boolean) When matching a Route via one of the `hosts` domain names, use the request `Host` header in the upstream request headers. If set to `false`, the upstream `Host` header will be that of the Service's `host`.
- `protocols` (List of String) An array of the protocols this Route should allow. See the [Route Object](#route-object) section for a list of accepted protocols. When set to only `"https"`, HTTP requests are answered with an upgrade error. When set to only `"http"`, HTTPS requests are answered with an error.
- `regex_priority` (Number) A number used to choose which route resolves a given request when several routes match it using regexes simultaneously. When two routes match the path and have the same `regex_priority`, the older one (lowest `created_at`) is used. Note that the priority for non-regex routes is different (longer non-regex routes are matched before shorter ones).
- `request_buffering` (Boolean) Whether to enable request body buffering or not. With HTTP 1.1, it may make sense to turn this off on services that receive data with chunked transfer encoding.
- `response_buffering` (Boolean) Whether to enable response body buffering or not. With HTTP 1.1, it may make sense to turn this off on services that send data with chunked transfer encoding.
- `service` (Attributes) The Service this Route is associated to. This is where the Route proxies traffic to. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--service))
- `snis` (List of String) A list of SNIs that match this Route when using stream routing.
- `sources` (Attributes List) A list of IP sources of incoming connections that match this Route when using stream routing. Each entry is an object with fields "ip" (optionally in CIDR range notation) and/or "port". (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sources))
- `strip_path` (Boolean) When matching a Route via one of the `paths`, strip the matching prefix from the upstream request URL.
- `tags` (List of String) An optional set of strings associated with the Route for grouping and filtering.
- `updated_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was last updated.
