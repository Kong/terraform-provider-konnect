GatewayPluginAcme DataSource

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "konnect_gateway_plugin_acme" "my_gatewaypluginacme" {

}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `control_plane_id` (String) The UUID of your control plane. This variable is available in the Konnect manager.

### Read-Only

- `config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config))
- `created_at` (Number) Unix epoch when the resource was created.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the plugin is applied.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `instance_name` (String)
- `ordering` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ordering))

### Nested Schema for `config`

Read-Only:

- `account_email` (String) The account identifier. Can be reused in a different plugin instance.
- `account_key` (Attributes) The private key associated with the account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--account_key))
- `allow_any_domain` (Boolean) If set to `true`, the plugin allows all domains and ignores any values in the `domains` list.
- `api_uri` (String) A string representing a URL, such as https://example.com/path/to/resource?q=search.
- `cert_type` (String) The certificate type to create. The possible values are `rsa` for RSA certificate or `ecc` for EC certificate.
- `domains` (List of String) An array of strings representing hosts. A valid host is a string containing one or more labels separated by periods, with at most one wildcard label ('*')
- `eab_hmac_key` (String) External account binding (EAB) base64-encoded URL string of the HMAC key. You usually don't need to set this unless it is explicitly required by the CA.
- `eab_kid` (String) External account binding (EAB) key id. You usually don't need to set this unless it is explicitly required by the CA.
- `enable_ipv4_common_name` (Boolean) A boolean value that controls whether to include the IPv4 address in the common name field of generated certificates.
- `fail_backoff_minutes` (Number) Minutes to wait for each domain that fails to create a certificate. This applies to both a
new certificate and a renewal certificate.
- `preferred_chain` (String) A string value that specifies the preferred certificate chain to use when generating certificates.
- `renew_threshold_days` (Number) Days remaining to renew the certificate before it expires.
- `rsa_key_size` (Number) RSA private key size for the certificate. The possible values are 2048, 3072, or 4096.
- `storage` (String) The backend storage type to use. In DB-less mode and Konnect, `kong` storage is unavailable. In hybrid mode and Konnect, `shm` storage is unavailable. `shm` storage does not persist during Kong restarts and does not work for Kong running on different machines, so consider using one of `kong`, `redis`, `consul`, or `vault` in production.
- `storage_config` (Attributes) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--storage_config))
- `tos_accepted` (Boolean) If you are using Let's Encrypt, you must set this to `true` to agree the terms of service.
