# konnect_mesh_timeout_list (Data Source)

MeshTimeoutList DataSource

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "konnect_mesh_timeout_list" "my_meshtimeoutlist" {
  cp_id = "bf138ba2-c9b1-4229-b268-04d9d8a6410b"
  mesh  = "...my_mesh..."
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cp_id` (String) Id of the Konnect resource
- `mesh` (String) name of the mesh

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `next` (String) URL to the next page
- `total` (Number) The total number of entities

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `creation_time` (String) Time at which the resource was created
- `labels` (Map of String) The labels to help identity resources
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is the name of the Kuma mesh this resource belongs to. It may be omitted for cluster-scoped resources.
- `modification_time` (String) Time at which the resource was updated
- `name` (String) Name of the Kuma resource
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTimeout resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec))
- `type` (String) the type of the resource

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec`

Read-Only:

- `from` (Attributes List) From list makes a match between clients and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from))
- `rules` (Attributes List) Rules defines inbound timeout configurations. Currently limited to exactly one rule containing
default timeouts that apply to all inbound traffic, as L7 matching is not yet implemented. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--rules))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource the policy takes an effect on.
The resource could be either a real store object or virtual resource
defined inplace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--target_ref))
- `to` (Attributes List) To list makes a match between the consumed services and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--to))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--from"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from`

Read-Only:

- `default` (Attributes) Default is a configuration specific to the group of clients referenced in
'targetRef' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from--default))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource that represents a group of
clients. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--from--default"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from.default`

Read-Only:

- `connection_timeout` (String) ConnectionTimeout specifies the amount of time proxy will wait for an TCP connection to be established.
Default value is 5 seconds. Cannot be set to 0.
- `http` (Attributes) Http provides configuration for HTTP specific timeouts (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from--default--http))
- `idle_timeout` (String) IdleTimeout is defined as the period in which there are no bytes sent or received on connection
Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Be cautious when disabling it because
it can lead to connection leaking. Default value is 1h.

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--from--default--http"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from.default.http`

Read-Only:

- `max_connection_duration` (String) MaxConnectionDuration is the time after which a connection will be drained and/or closed,
starting from when it was first established. Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it.
Disabled by default.
- `max_stream_duration` (String) MaxStreamDuration is the maximum time that a stream’s lifetime will span.
Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Disabled by default.
- `request_headers_timeout` (String) RequestHeadersTimeout The amount of time that proxy will wait for the request headers to be received. The timer is
activated when the first byte of the headers is received, and is disarmed when the last byte of
the headers has been received. If not specified or set to 0, this timeout is disabled.
Disabled by default.
- `request_timeout` (String) RequestTimeout The amount of time that proxy will wait for the entire request to be received.
The timer is activated when the request is initiated, and is disarmed when the last byte of the request is sent,
OR when the response is initiated. Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it.
Default is 15s.
- `stream_idle_timeout` (String) StreamIdleTimeout is the amount of time that proxy will allow a stream to exist with no activity.
Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it. Default is 30m

### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from.target_ref`

Read-Only:
