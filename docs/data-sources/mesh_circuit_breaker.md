<a id="nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.from.default.outlier_detection.detectors`

Read-Only:

- `failure_percentage` (Attributes) Failure Percentage based outlier detection functions similarly to success
rate detection, in that it relies on success rate data from each host in
a cluster. However, rather than compare those values to the mean success
rate of the cluster as a whole, they are compared to a flat
user-configured threshold. This threshold is configured via the
outlierDetection.failurePercentageThreshold field.
The other configuration fields for failure percentage based detection are
similar to the fields for success rate detection. As with success rate
detection, detection will not be performed for a host if its request
volume over the aggregation interval is less than the
outlierDetection.detectors.failurePercentage.requestVolume value.
Detection also will not be performed for a cluster if the number of hosts
with the minimum required request volume in an interval is less than the
outlierDetection.detectors.failurePercentage.minimumHosts value. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--failure_percentage))
- `gateway_failures` (Attributes) In the default mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is
false) this detection type takes into account a subset of 5xx errors,
called "gateway errors" (502, 503 or 504 status code) and local origin
failures, such as timeout, TCP reset etc.
In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true)
this detection type takes into account a subset of 5xx errors, called
"gateway errors" (502, 503 or 504 status code) and is supported only by
the http router. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--gateway_failures))
- `local_origin_failures` (Attributes) This detection type is enabled only when
outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true and takes into
account only locally originated errors (timeout, reset, etc).
If Envoy repeatedly cannot connect to an upstream host or communication
with the upstream host is repeatedly interrupted, it will be ejected.
Various locally originated problems are detected: timeout, TCP reset,
ICMP errors, etc. This detection type is supported by http router and
tcp proxy. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--local_origin_failures))
- `success_rate` (Attributes) Success Rate based outlier detection aggregates success rate data from
every host in a cluster. Then at given intervals ejects hosts based on
statistical outlier detection. Success Rate outlier detection will not be
calculated for a host if its request volume over the aggregation interval
is less than the outlierDetection.detectors.successRate.requestVolume
value.
Moreover, detection will not be performed for a cluster if the number of
hosts with the minimum required request volume in an interval is less
than the outlierDetection.detectors.successRate.minimumHosts value.
In the default configuration mode
(outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is false) this detection
type takes into account all types of errors: locally and externally
originated.
In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true),
locally originated errors and externally originated (transaction) errors
are counted and treated separately. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--success_rate))
- `total_failures` (Attributes) In the default mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalAndLocalErrors is
false) this detection type takes into account all generated errors:
locally originated and externally originated (transaction) errors.
In split mode (outlierDetection.splitExternalLocalOriginErrors is true)
this detection type takes into account only externally originated
(transaction) errors, ignoring locally originated errors.
If an upstream host is an HTTP-server, only 5xx types of error are taken
into account (see Consecutive Gateway Failure for exceptions).
Properly formatted responses, even when they carry an operational error
(like index not found, access denied) are not taken into account. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--from--default--outlier_detection--detectors--total_failures))

interval (as defined by the interval duration above) to perform failure
percentage-based ejection for this host. If the volume is lower than this

host.
- `threshold` (Number) The failure percentage to use when determining failure percentage-based
outlier detection. If the failure percentage of a given host is greater
than or equal to this value, it will be ejected.
