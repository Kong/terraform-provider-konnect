Leave unset for the plugin to activate regardless of the authenticated Consumer. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--consumer))
- `consumer_group` (Attributes) If set, the plugin will activate only for requests where the specified consumer group has been authenticated. (Note that some plugins can not be restricted to consumers groups this way.).

<a id="nestedatt--config--behavior"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.behavior`

Read-Only:

- `idp_error_response_body_template` (String) The template to use to create the body of the response to return to the consumer if Kong fails to obtain a token from the IdP.
- `idp_error_response_content_type` (String) The Content-Type of the response to return to the consumer if Kong fails to obtain a token from the IdP.
- `idp_error_response_message` (String) The message to embed in the body of the response to return to the consumer if Kong fails to obtain a token from the IdP.

- `purge_token_on_upstream_status_codes` (List of Number) An array of status codes which will force an access token to be purged when returned by the upstream. An empty array will disable this functionality.
- `upstream_access_token_header_name` (String) The name of the header used to send the access token (obtained from the IdP) to the upstream service.


<a id="nestedatt--config--cache"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.cache`

Read-Only:

- `strategy` (String) The method Kong should use to cache tokens issued by the IdP.

<a id="nestedatt--config--cache--memory"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.cache.memory`

Read-Only:

- `dictionary_name` (String) The shared dictionary used by the plugin to cache tokens if `config.cache.strategy` is set to `memory`.


<a id="nestedatt--config--cache--redis"></a>
### Nested Schema for `config.cache.redis`

Read-Only:

- `cluster_max_redirections` (Number) Maximum retry attempts for redirection.
- `cluster_nodes` (Attributes List) Cluster addresses to use for Redis connections when the `redis` strategy is defined. Defining this field implies using a Redis Cluster. The minimum length of the array is 1 element. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--cache--redis--cluster_nodes))
- `connect_timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2.
- `connection_is_proxied` (Boolean) If the connection to Redis is proxied (e.g. Envoy), set it `true`. Set the `host` and `port` to point to the proxy address.
- `database` (Number) Database to use for the Redis connection when using the `redis` strategy
- `host` (String) A string representing a host name, such as example.com.
- `keepalive_backlog` (Number) Limits the total number of opened connections for a pool. If the connection pool is full, connection queues above the limit go into the backlog queue. If the backlog queue is full, subsequent connect operations fail and return `nil`. Queued operations (subject to set timeouts) resume once the number of connections in the pool is less than `keepalive_pool_size`. If latency is high or throughput is low, try increasing this value. Empirically, this value is larger than `keepalive_pool_size`.
- `keepalive_pool_size` (Number) The size limit for every cosocket connection pool associated with every remote server, per worker process. If neither `keepalive_pool_size` nor `keepalive_backlog` is specified, no pool is created. If `keepalive_pool_size` isn't specified but `keepalive_backlog` is specified, then the pool uses the default value. Try to increase (e.g. 512) this value if latency is high or throughput is low.
- `password` (String) Password to use for Redis connections. If undefined, no AUTH commands are sent to Redis.
- `port` (Number) An integer representing a port number between 0 and 65535, inclusive.
- `read_timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2.
- `send_timeout` (Number) An integer representing a timeout in milliseconds. Must be between 0 and 2^31-2.
- `sentinel_master` (String) Sentinel master to use for Redis connections. Defining this value implies using Redis Sentinel.
- `sentinel_nodes` (Attributes List) Sentinel node addresses to use for Redis connections when the `redis` strategy is defined. Defining this field implies using a Redis Sentinel. The minimum length of the array is 1 element. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--config--cache--redis--sentinel_nodes))
- `sentinel_password` (String) Sentinel password to authenticate with a Redis Sentinel instance. If undefined, no AUTH commands are sent to Redis Sentinels.
- `sentinel_role` (String) Sentinel role to use for Redis connections when the `redis` strategy is defined. Defining this value implies using Redis Sentinel.
- `sentinel_username` (String) Sentinel username to authenticate with a Redis Sentinel instance. If undefined, ACL authentication won't be performed. This requires Redis v6.2.0+.
- `server_name` (String) A string representing an SNI (server name indication) value for TLS.
- `ssl` (Boolean) If set to true, uses SSL to connect to Redis.
- `ssl_verify` (Boolean) If set to true, verifies the validity of the server SSL certificate. If setting this parameter, also configure `lua_ssl_trusted_certificate` in `kong.conf` to specify the CA (or server) certificate used by your Redis server. You may also need to configure `lua_ssl_verify_depth` accordingly.
- `username` (String) Username to use for Redis connections. If undefined, ACL authentication won't be performed. This requires Redis v6.0.0+. To be compatible with Redis v5.x.y, you can set it to `default`.
