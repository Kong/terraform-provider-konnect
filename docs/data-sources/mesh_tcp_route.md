# konnect_mesh_tcp_route (Data Source)

MeshTCPRoute DataSource

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "konnect_mesh_tcp_route" "my_meshtcproute" {
  cp_id = "bf138ba2-c9b1-4229-b268-04d9d8a6410b"
  mesh  = "...my_mesh..."
  name  = "...my_name..."
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cp_id` (String) Id of the Konnect resource
- `mesh` (String) name of the mesh
- `name` (String) name of the MeshTCPRoute

### Read-Only

- `creation_time` (String) Time at which the resource was created
- `labels` (Map of String) The labels to help identity resources
- `modification_time` (String) Time at which the resource was updated
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTCPRoute resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec))
- `type` (String) the type of the resource

<a id="nestedatt--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec`

Read-Only:

- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource the policy takes an effect on.
The resource could be either a real store object or virtual resource
defined in-place. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--target_ref))
- `to` (Attributes List) To list makes a match between the consumed services and corresponding
configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--target_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.target_ref`

Read-Only:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are used to select group of MeshServices that match labels. Either Labels or
Name and Namespace can be used.
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is reserved for future use to identify cross mesh resources.
- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds
`MeshSubset` and `MeshServiceSubset`


<a id="nestedatt--spec--to"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.to`

Read-Only:

- `rules` (Attributes List) Rules contains the routing rules applies to a combination of top-level
targetRef and the targetRef in this entry. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--rules))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource that represents a group of
destinations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--to--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.to.rules`

Read-Only:

- `default` (Attributes) Default holds routing rules that can be merged with rules from other
policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--rules--default))

<a id="nestedatt--spec--to--rules--default"></a>
### Nested Schema for `spec.to.rules.default`

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `port` (Number) Port is only supported when this ref refers to a real MeshService object
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds
`MeshSubset` and `MeshServiceSubset`
