# konnect_mesh_traffic_permission_list (Data Source)

MeshTrafficPermissionList DataSource

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "konnect_mesh_traffic_permission_list" "my_meshtrafficpermissionlist" {
  cp_id = "bf138ba2-c9b1-4229-b268-04d9d8a6410b"
  mesh  = "...my_mesh..."
}
```

<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `cp_id` (String) Id of the Konnect resource
- `mesh` (String) name of the mesh

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `next` (String) URL to the next page
- `total` (Number) The total number of entities

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `creation_time` (String) Time at which the resource was created
- `labels` (Map of String) The labels to help identity resources
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is the name of the Kuma mesh this resource belongs to. It may be omitted for cluster-scoped resources.
- `modification_time` (String) Time at which the resource was updated
- `name` (String) Name of the Kuma resource
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTrafficPermission resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec))
- `type` (String) the type of the resource

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec`

Read-Only:

- `from` (Attributes List) From list makes a match between clients and corresponding configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource the policy takes an effect on.
The resource could be either a real store object or virtual resource
defined inplace. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--from"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from`

Read-Only:

- `default` (Attributes) Default is a configuration specific to the group of clients referenced in
'targetRef' (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from--default))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource that represents a group of
clients. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--from--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--from--default"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from.default`

Read-Only:

- `action` (String) Action defines a behavior for the specified group of clients:


<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--from--target_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.from.target_ref`

Read-Only:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are used to select group of MeshServices that match labels. Either Labels or
Name and Namespace can be used.
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is reserved for future use to identify cross mesh resources.
- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds
`MeshSubset` and `MeshServiceSubset`
