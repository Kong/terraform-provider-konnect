backoff strategy between retries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--default--grpc--back_off))

retriable) requests. If not set, the default value is 1.
- `per_try_timeout` (String) PerTryTimeout is the maximum amount of time each retry attempt can take
before it times out. If not set, the global request timeout for the route
will be used. Setting this value to 0 will disable the per-try timeout.
- `rate_limited_back_off` (Attributes) RateLimitedBackOff is a configuration of backoff which will be used when
the upstream returns one of the headers configured. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--default--grpc--rate_limited_back_off))

case-insensitive. The first header to be parsed successfully is used.

### Nested Schema for `spec.to.default.http`

Read-Only:

- `back_off` (Attributes) BackOff is a configuration of durations which will be used in exponential
backoff strategy between retries. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--default--http--back_off))
- `host_selection` (Attributes List) HostSelection is a list of predicates that dictate how hosts should be selected
when requests are retried. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--default--http--host_selection))
- `host_selection_max_attempts` (Number) HostSelectionMaxAttempts is the maximum number of times host selection will be
reattempted before giving up, at which point the host that was last selected will
be routed to. If unspecified, this will default to retrying once.
- `num_retries` (Number) NumRetries is the number of attempts that will be made on failed (and
retriable) requests.  If not set, the default value is 1.

If left unspecified, the global route timeout for the request will be used.
Consequently, when using a 5xx based retry policy, a request that times out
will not be retried as the total timeout budget would have been exhausted.
Setting this timeout to 0 will disable it.
- `rate_limited_back_off` (Attributes) RateLimitedBackOff is a configuration of backoff which will be used
when the upstream returns one of the headers configured. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--default--http--rate_limited_back_off))

- `retriable_response_headers` (Attributes List) RetriableResponseHeaders is an HTTP response headers that trigger a retry
if present in the response. A retry will be triggered if any of the header
matches the upstream response headers. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--spec--to--default--http--retriable_response_headers))
- `retry_on` (List of String) RetryOn is a list of conditions which will cause a retry. Available values are:
[5XX, GatewayError, Reset, Retriable4xx, ConnectFailure, EnvoyRatelimited,
