# konnect_mesh_tcp_route_list (Data Source)

MeshTCPRouteList DataSource

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "konnect_mesh_tcp_route_list" "my_meshtcproutelist" {
  cp_id = "bf138ba2-c9b1-4229-b268-04d9d8a6410b"
  mesh  = "...my_mesh..."
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cp_id` (String) Id of the Konnect resource
- `mesh` (String) name of the mesh

### Read-Only

- `items` (Attributes List) (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items))
- `next` (String) URL to the next page
- `total` (Number) The total number of entities

<a id="nestedatt--items"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items`

Read-Only:

- `creation_time` (String) Time at which the resource was created
- `labels` (Map of String) The labels to help identity resources
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is the name of the Kuma mesh this resource belongs to. It may be omitted for cluster-scoped resources.
- `modification_time` (String) Time at which the resource was updated
- `name` (String) Name of the Kuma resource
- `spec` (Attributes) Spec is the specification of the Kuma MeshTCPRoute resource. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec))
- `type` (String) the type of the resource

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec`

Read-Only:

- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource the policy takes an effect on.
The resource could be either a real store object or virtual resource
defined in-place. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--target_ref))
- `to` (Attributes List) To list makes a match between the consumed services and corresponding
configurations (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--to))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--target_ref"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.target_ref`

Read-Only:

- `kind` (String) Kind of the referenced resource
- `labels` (Map of String) Labels are used to select group of MeshServices that match labels. Either Labels or
Name and Namespace can be used.
- `mesh` (String) Mesh is reserved for future use to identify cross mesh resources.
- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
For example, you can target port from MeshService.ports[] by its name. Only traffic to this port will be affected.
- `tags` (Map of String) Tags used to select a subset of proxies by tags. Can only be used with kinds
`MeshSubset` and `MeshServiceSubset`

### Nested Schema for `items.spec.to`

Read-Only:

- `rules` (Attributes List) Rules contains the routing rules applies to a combination of top-level
targetRef and the targetRef in this entry. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--to--rules))
- `target_ref` (Attributes) TargetRef is a reference to the resource that represents a group of
destinations. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--to--target_ref))

<a id="nestedatt--items--spec--to--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `items.spec.to.rules`

Read-Only:

- `default` (Attributes) Default holds routing rules that can be merged with rules from other
policies. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--items--spec--to--rules--default))

- `name` (String) Name of the referenced resource. Can only be used with kinds: `MeshService`,
`MeshServiceSubset` and `MeshGatewayRoute`
- `namespace` (String) Namespace specifies the namespace of target resource. If empty only resources in policy namespace
will be targeted.
- `port` (Number) Port is only supported when this ref refers to a real MeshService object
- `proxy_types` (List of String) ProxyTypes specifies the data plane types that are subject to the policy. When not specified,
all data plane types are targeted by the policy.
- `section_name` (String) SectionName is used to target specific section of resource.
