## 2.0.2
> Released on 2024/11/12

## 2.0.1
> Released on 2024/11/11

### Bug Fixes

* Switched `CLUSTER_TYPE_HYBRID` to a deprecation rather than a hard removal as changing the `type` results in resource replacement

## 2.0.0
> Released on 2024/11/11

### ðŸš¨ BREAKING CHANGES
* The `konnect_cloud_gateway_transit_gateway` resource structure has had a bug fix that enables both AWS and Azure support. This has changed the resource structure and you will need to recreate any transit gateway attachments.
* `CLUSTER_TYPE_HYBRID` is an internal cluster name which has now been removed from the provider. Use `CLUSTER_TYPE_CONTROL_PLANE` instead. 
* Setting `scopes = []` in the OpenID Connect plugin is now respected. This means that the default has changed from `['openid']` to `[]`.
