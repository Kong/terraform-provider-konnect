	// Create and maintain a centralized catalog of all services running in your organization.
	// Add custom fields and map resources from across your organization to provide a 360-degree overview of your services.
	//
	// Custom fields allow you to surface key information such as:
	// - `Owner`: The person or team responsible for the service
	// - `Product Manager`: The person assigned to guide the service's direction for customer success
	// - `Jira Project`: The Jira project which represents past, present and future work for the service
	//
	// Resources are discovered from the integrations you use within your organization to create, operate and manage your services.
	// Mapping the resources relevant to your service will provide a rich view of the service's communication channels, dependencies and more.
	// Types of resources which you can map to a service include:
	// - `Code Repositories:` The software project(s) that make up the service
	// - `Monitors and Dashboards:` Tools providing visibility into the health and performance of the service
	// - `Communication Channels`: Virtual spaces where questions and concerns can be raised about the service
	// - `Incident Management Resources`: Alerts setup within your incident management platform to notify individuals regarding issues with the service

	// Customer Managed Encryption Keys (CMEK) are used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data in Konnect. They allow you to manage your own encryption keys using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). CMEKs provide an additional layer of security and compliance for your Konnect deployments, ensuring that your data is encrypted with keys that you control. Avoid revoking or deleting a KMS key and CMEK that is actively used by Konnect, as this can lead to data loss or service disruptions.

	// Konnect-internal integrations are built-in and do not need to be installed.
	//
	// Once an integration instance is created, authorize the instance to allow the Service Catalog to discover its resources.
	// Note that deleting an integration instance is a **destructive** operation.
	// When an integration instance is deleted, all its resources and mappings will be deleted from the service catalog.
	// In cases where the integration instance's credentials need to be updated, you may re-authorize the instance to retain all currently discovered resources and mappings.
	// To set up and view a list of all the integrations we support, please view our [documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/service-catalog/integrations/).

	IntegrationInstances *IntegrationInstances
	// A integration instance may need to be provided with an auth config before authorizing the instance.
	// Typically an auth config will be required when authorizing against a integration which is hosted within your organization.
	// The integration instance's auth config will inform how the Service Catalog will authorize the integration instance.
	// Note that updating the auth config for an instance which is already authorized will **remove the existing credential**, requiring you to re-authorize the instance.
	//
	IntegrationInstanceAuthConfig *IntegrationInstanceAuthConfig
	// Represents the credentials use to authorize an integration instance.
	// You will want to configure the integration instance settings and authorization configuration before authorizing the instance.
	// This will inform the authorization process on how to reach and authorize the account.
	// Once the integration instance is authorized, the system will automatically discover all the relevant resources from the account.
	// The integration instance's auth credentials can be removed or updated while retaining all resources which have already been discovered.

	// Consumers can be scoped to a Konnect region and managed centrally, or be scoped to a control plane in Gateway Manager. Use centrally managed consumers to set up identity of the consumer once, and share it across multiple control planes. Consumers that are managed centrally aren’t part of the configuration that is pushed down from the control plane to the data planes, so it reduces config size and latency.

	// A CA certificate object represents a trusted certificate authority.
	// These objects are used by Kong Gateway to verify the validity of a client or server certificate.
	CACertificates *CACertificates
	// A certificate object represents a public certificate, and can be optionally paired with the corresponding private key. These objects are used by Kong Gateway to handle SSL/TLS termination for encrypted requests, or for use as a trusted CA store when validating peer certificate of client/service.
	// <br><br>
	// Certificates are optionally associated with SNI objects to tie a cert/key pair to one or more hostnames.
	// <br><br>
	// If intermediate certificates are required in addition to the main certificate, they should be concatenated together into one string.
	//
	Certificates *Certificates
	// Consumer groups enable the organization and categorization of consumers (users or applications) within an API ecosystem.
	// By grouping consumers together, you eliminate the need to manage them individually, providing a scalable, efficient approach to managing configurations.
	ConsumerGroups *ConsumerGroups
	// The consumer object represents a consumer - or a user - of a service.

	CustomPlugins        *CustomPlugins
	// A JSON Web key set. Key sets are the preferred way to expose keys to plugins because they tell the plugin where to look for keys or have a scoping mechanism to restrict plugins to specific keys.
	//
	KeySets *KeySets
	// A key object holds a representation of asymmetric keys in various formats. When Kong Gateway or a Kong plugin requires a specific public or private key to perform certain operations, it can use this entity.
	//
	Keys *Keys
	// Some entities in Kong Gateway share common configuration settings that often need to be repeated. For example, multiple plugins that connect to Redis may require the same connection settings. Without Partials, you would need to replicate this configuration across all plugins. If the settings change, you would need to update each plugin individually.
	Partials *Partials
	// Custom Plugin Schemas
	CustomPluginSchemas *CustomPluginSchemas
	// A plugin entity represents a plugin configuration that will be executed during the HTTP request/response lifecycle. Plugins let you add functionality to services that run behind a Kong Gateway instance, like authentication or rate limiting.
	// You can find more information about available plugins and which values each plugin accepts at the [Plugin Hub](https://developer.konghq.com/plugins/).
	// <br><br>
	// When adding a plugin configuration to a service, the plugin will run on every request made by a client to that service. If a plugin needs to be tuned to different values for some specific consumers, you can do so by creating a separate plugin instance that specifies both the service and the consumer, through the service and consumer fields.
	Plugins *Plugins
	// Route entities define rules to match client requests. Each route is associated with a service, and a service may have multiple routes associated to it. Every request matching a given route will be proxied to the associated service. You need at least one matching rule that applies to the protocol being matched by the route.
	// <br><br>
	// The combination of routes and services, and the separation of concerns between them, offers a powerful routing mechanism with which it is possible to define fine-grained entrypoints in Kong Gateway leading to different upstream services of your infrastructure.
	// <br><br>
	// Depending on the protocol, one of the following attributes must be set:
	// <br>
	//
	// - `http`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`
	// - `https`: At least one of `methods`, `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`
	// - `tcp`: At least one of `sources` or `destinations`
	// - `tls`: at least one of `sources`, `destinations`, or `snis`
	// - `tls_passthrough`: set `snis`
	// - `grpc`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`
	// - `grpcs`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`
	// - `ws`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, or `paths`
	// - `wss`: At least one of `hosts`, `headers`, `paths`, or `snis`
	//
	//   <br>
	//   A route can't have both `tls` and `tls_passthrough` protocols at same time.
	//   <br><br>
	//   Learn more about the router:
	// - [Configure routes using expressions](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/routing/expressions/)
	//
	Routes *Routes
	// Service entities are abstractions of your microservice interfaces or formal APIs. For example, a service could be a data transformation microservice or a billing API.
	// <br><br>
	// The main attribute of a service is the destination URL for proxying traffic. This URL can be set as a single string or by specifying its protocol, host, port and path individually.
	// <br><br>
	// Services are associated to routes, and a single service can have many routes associated with it. Routes are entrypoints in Kong Gateway which define rules to match client requests. Once a route is matched, Kong Gateway proxies the request to its associated service. See the [Route documentation](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/entities/route/) for a detailed explanation of how Kong proxies traffic.
	// <br><br>
	// Services can be both [tagged and filtered by tags](https://developer.konghq.com/admin-api/).
	//
	Services *Services
	// An SNI object represents a many-to-one mapping of hostnames to a certificate.
	// <br><br>
	// A certificate object can have many hostnames associated with it. When Kong Gateway receives an SSL request, it uses the SNI field in the Client Hello to look up the certificate object based on the SNI associated with the certificate.
	SNIs *SNIs
	// The upstream object represents a virtual hostname and can be used to load balance incoming requests over multiple services (targets).
	// <br><br>
	// An upstream also includes a [health checker](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/traffic-control/health-checks-circuit-breakers/), which can enable and disable targets based on their ability or inability to serve requests.
	// The configuration for the health checker is stored in the upstream object, and applies to all of its targets.
	Upstreams *Upstreams
	// A target is an IP address or hostname with a port that identifies an instance of a backend service. Every upstream can have many targets, and the targets can be dynamically added, modified, or deleted. Changes take effect on the fly.
	// <br><br>
	// To disable a target, post a new one with `weight=0`, or use the `DELETE` method to accomplish the same.
	//
	Targets *Targets
	// Vault objects are used to configure different vault connectors for [managing secrets](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/secrets-management/).
	// Configuring a vault lets you reference secrets from other entities.
	// This allows for a proper separation of secrets and configuration and prevents secret sprawl.
	// <br><br>
	// For example, you could store a certificate and a key in a vault, then reference them from a certificate entity. This way, the certificate and key are not stored in the entity directly and are more secure.
	// <br><br>
	// Secrets rotation can be managed using [TTLs](https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/entities/vault/).
